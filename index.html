                  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                  is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                  example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                  its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                  and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                  structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                  variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                  example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                    and page navigation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                    the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

            <header>Why to Learn JavaScript?</header>
            <article>
                <p>Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</li>
                    <li>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</li>
                    <li>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.</li>
                    <li>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.</li>
                    <li>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.</li>

            <header>Applications of JavaScript</header>
            <article>
                <p>As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Client side validation</b> - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validating those inputs at front-end itself.</li>
                    <li><b>Manipulating HTML Pages</b> - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.</li>
                    <li><b> User Notifications</b> - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.</li>
                    <li><b>Back-end Data Loading</b> - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.</li>
                    <li><b> Presentations</b> - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.</li>
                    <li><b> Server Applications</b> - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                  JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                  in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                  Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                  Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                  constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                  JavaScript.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                  declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                  number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                  JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                  class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                  inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                  JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                  requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                  loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                  have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                  be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                  you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                  function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World!">
            <header>Hello World!</header>
            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code
                  >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                  greetMe("World");
                </code>
          
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
              </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                  With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                  always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                  warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                  below.
                </p>
              </article>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
        is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code
        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code
      >
    </article>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                  Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                  pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                  variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                  frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                  name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                  document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                  parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>
              </article>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                  You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                  syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                  identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                  can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
          
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                  A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                  while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                  variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                  represent a variable.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                  variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
          
                <code
                  >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                  CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                  }</code
                >
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                is executed without problems.
                <code
                  >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code
                >
              </article>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                      <li>
                        null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                        is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                        other variant.
                      </li>
                      <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                      <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                      <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                      <li>
                        Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                        unique and immutable.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
          
                  <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
          
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code
                  >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                  } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
          
                <code
                  >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                  statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                  statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                  statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
                >
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
          
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="While_Statements">
            <header>While Statements</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
      statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>

      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>

      Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates.

            <header>Function Declaration</header>
            <article>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
          
                <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                    separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                    brackets, { }.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>
          
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                  The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                  consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                  function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                  specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                  Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                  value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                  the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                  the calling function.
